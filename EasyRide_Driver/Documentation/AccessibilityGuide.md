# EasyRide Accessibility Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive accessibility features implemented in the EasyRide iOS application to ensure full compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards and Apple's accessibility guidelines.

## Accessibility Features Implemented

### 1. VoiceOver Support

#### Service Selection View
- **Service Cards**: Each service card has a comprehensive accessibility label that includes:
  - Service type name (e.g., "Airport Transfer")
  - Estimated price information
  - Selection state ("Selected" or "Not selected")
- **Accessibility Hints**: Clear instructions for interaction ("Double tap to select this service")
- **Dynamic Announcements**: Selection changes are announced immediately
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order through service options

#### Trip Configuration View
- **Mode Selector**: Trip mode buttons announce their state and provide clear descriptions
- **Form Fields**: All input fields have descriptive labels and helpful hints
- **Date Picker**: Properly labeled with instructions for rotor navigation
- **Passenger Stepper**: Buttons announce current count and provide clear increment/decrement actions
- **Address Fields**: Autocomplete fields with clear labeling and search functionality

#### Order Tracking View
- **Status Updates**: Real-time status changes are announced automatically
- **Progress Indicators**: Matching progress includes percentage completion announcements
- **Driver Information**: Complete driver details are accessible including ratings and vehicle info
- **Communication Buttons**: Clear labels and hints for calling or messaging driver

#### Value Added Services View
- **Service Options**: Toggle switches with comprehensive descriptions including pricing
- **Price Breakdown**: All pricing information is accessible with proper currency formatting
- **Payment Methods**: Clear identification of payment options and selection state

### 2. Focus Management

#### Logical Focus Order
- **Sequential Navigation**: All interactive elements follow a logical top-to-bottom, left-to-right order
- **Focus Containment**: Modal dialogs and sheets properly contain focus
- **Focus Restoration**: When dismissing overlays, focus returns to the triggering element

#### Focus Indicators
- **Visual Focus**: High contrast focus indicators for Switch Control users
- **Focus Announcements**: Screen reader users receive clear focus change notifications

### 3. Dynamic Content Announcements

#### Real-time Updates
- **Status Changes**: Order status updates are announced immediately
- **Price Updates**: Dynamic price changes are announced when services are added/removed
- **Form Validation**: Error messages and validation feedback are announced
- **Loading States**: Progress and loading indicators provide ongoing feedback

#### Announcement Priorities
- **High Priority**: Critical status changes (driver assigned, trip completed)
- **Medium Priority**: Form validation and user actions
- **Low Priority**: Informational updates and progress indicators

### 4. High Contrast Mode Support

#### Color Schemes
- **Adaptive Colors**: All UI elements adapt to high contrast preferences
- **Text Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Interactive Elements**: Enhanced contrast for buttons and interactive components
- **Status Indicators**: Color-independent status communication using text and symbols

#### Implementation
```swift
// Example of high contrast support
.contrastSensitiveColor(normal: .blue, highContrast: .black)
```

### 5. Reduced Motion Support

#### Animation Control
- **Motion Detection**: All animations respect `UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled`
- **Alternative Feedback**: Non-motion feedback for users with vestibular disorders
- **Essential Motion**: Only critical animations (like progress indicators) remain active

#### Implementation Examples
```swift
// Motion-sensitive animations
.motionSensitiveAnimation(.spring(response: 0.6), value: isSelected)

// Conditional animation application
withAnimation(AccessibilityUtils.isReduceMotionEnabled ? nil : .spring()) {
    // Animation code
}
```

## Accessibility Utilities

### AccessibilityUtils Class

The `AccessibilityUtils` class provides centralized accessibility functionality:

#### Environment Detection
- `isVoiceOverRunning`: Detects active screen reader
- `isReduceMotionEnabled`: Checks motion preferences
- `isDarkerSystemColorsEnabled`: Detects high contrast mode

#### Announcement Methods
- `announce(_:priority:)`: Posts accessibility announcements
- `announceLayoutChange(focusOn:)`: Manages focus changes
- `announceScreenChange(focusOn:)`: Handles major navigation changes

#### Label Generation
- `serviceCardLabel(for:price:isSelected:)`: Generates comprehensive service card labels
- `progressLabel(progress:description:)`: Creates progress indicator labels
- `priceLabel(amount:currency:)`: Formats currency for screen readers

### SwiftUI Extensions

Custom view modifiers for consistent accessibility implementation:

```swift
// Comprehensive accessibility support
.accessibilitySupport(
    label: "Service card",
    hint: "Double tap to select",
    traits: .button
)

// Button-specific accessibility
.accessibilityButton(
    label: "Continue",
    hint: "Proceeds to next step"
)

// Toggle-specific accessibility
.accessibilityToggle(
    label: "WiFi service",
    isOn: isSelected,
    hint: "Double tap to toggle"
)
```

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing

#### Unit Tests
- Accessibility label generation
- Focus management logic
- Announcement triggering
- Motion preference handling

#### UI Tests
- VoiceOver navigation flows
- Focus order verification
- Dynamic content announcements
- High contrast mode compatibility

### Manual Testing

#### VoiceOver Testing
1. Enable VoiceOver in Settings > Accessibility
2. Navigate through each screen using swipe gestures
3. Verify all content is accessible and properly labeled
4. Test form completion and submission flows
5. Verify dynamic content announcements

#### Switch Control Testing
1. Enable Switch Control in Settings > Accessibility
2. Configure switch inputs
3. Navigate through the app using switch controls
4. Verify all interactive elements are reachable
5. Test complex interactions like date picking

#### Voice Control Testing
1. Enable Voice Control in Settings > Accessibility
2. Test voice commands for navigation
3. Verify custom voice commands work correctly
4. Test form filling with voice input

## Best Practices

### Development Guidelines

1. **Test Early and Often**: Include accessibility testing in every development cycle
2. **Use Semantic Elements**: Leverage SwiftUI's built-in accessibility features
3. **Provide Context**: Ensure all interactive elements have clear purposes
4. **Handle State Changes**: Announce dynamic content updates appropriately
5. **Respect User Preferences**: Always honor accessibility settings

### Content Guidelines

1. **Clear Language**: Use simple, direct language in labels and hints
2. **Consistent Terminology**: Use the same terms throughout the app
3. **Meaningful Labels**: Avoid generic labels like "Button" or "Image"
4. **Helpful Hints**: Provide actionable guidance without being verbose
5. **Error Messages**: Make error messages clear and actionable
